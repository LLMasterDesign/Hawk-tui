▛///▞ VECTOR BINDING ::
//▞ Coordinate Space
axis: Z (evidence binding vector)
coordinate: [0, 0, 1]
type: direction (w=0)
translates: false
semantic: evidence anchor — PROVE

//▞ Plane Participation
XZ.plane = span{eₓ, e_z} → authority.z3n (identity + evidence)
YZ.plane = span{eᵧ, e_z} → kernel.z3n   (execution + evidence)
:: ∎

▛///▞ ρ{Evidence} :: Evidence Requirements

//▞ Evidence Principles
E1: All operations produce receipts
E2: Evidence is monotonic (cannot decrease)
E3: Claims must bind to evidence sources
E4: Unknowns are explicitly flagged, not hidden

rule: No silent operations permitted
enforcement: Receipt emission checked in ▷ phase
violation: EVIDENCE_FAULT

//▞ Evidence Types
direct_observation: Data from primary sources
derived_claim: Inference from evidence
unknown_flag: Insufficient evidence marker
fault_record: System error documentation

classification: Every artifact tagged with evidence type
binding: Claims reference evidence sources
:: ∎

▛///▞ φ{Schema} :: Receipt Schema

//▞ Receipt Structure
receipt_id: xxh64 hash
timestamp_sirius: ⧗-YY.SSS
core_version: 1.0.0
op_name: operation identifier
lex_namespace: LEX.{domain}

pico_trace:
  acquire:
    inputs: []
    evidence_count: 0
  transform:
    claims: []
    bindings: {}
  harden:
    guards_applied: []
    unknowns: []
  project:
    artifacts: []
    endstate: ""

claims_count: 0
unknowns_count: 0
policy_flags: []
endstate: SUCCESS|REFUSAL|UNKNOWN|FAULT
artifacts_emitted: []

//▞ Integrity Fields
inputs_hash: xxh64 of input payload
outputs_hash: xxh64 of output artifacts
trace_hash: xxh64 of pico_trace

purpose: Tamper detection
enforcement: Hashes computed at ▷ phase
violation: INTEGRITY_FAULT if mismatch detected

//▞ Schema Validation
- Receipt must conform to schema before emission
- All fields must be present (no optional fields)
- Unknown counts must match Unknown.List length
- EndState must be one of four valid values
:: ∎

▛///▞ τ{Receipt} :: Receipt Requirements

//▞ Mandatory Receipt
- Receipt emission occurs in ▷ phase
- Receipt reflects complete PiCO traversal
- Receipt is mandatory for ALL endstates
- No receipt = FAULT condition

enforcement: Kernel blocks completion until receipt written
violation: EVIDENCE_FAULT

//▞ Receipt Storage
primary: vec3/var/receipts/
backup: redis (if available)
format: JSON
retention: permanent

file_naming: {receipt_id}.receipt.json
access: read-only after write
indexing: by receipt_id, op_name, timestamp

//▞ Receipt Queries
by_id: Direct lookup via receipt_id
by_operation: Filter by op_name
by_timerange: Filter by timestamp_sirius
by_endstate: Filter by endstate value

purpose: Auditability and forensics
:: ∎

▛///▞ ENFORCEMENT ::

//▞ Verification Doctrine
- Verification is direction (w=0): translation forbidden
- Evidence is monotonic: cannot be decreased
- Receipt is mandatory: no operation completes without
- Unknowns are explicit: never hidden or suppressed

//▞ Receipt Guards
- Every operation MUST produce receipt
- Receipt MUST include PiCO trace
- Receipt MUST include endstate
- Receipt MUST include integrity hashes

enforcement: Kernel validates receipt before ▷ completion
violation: EVIDENCE_FAULT if receipt invalid or missing

//▞ Recovery
- EVIDENCE_FAULT: Receipt missing or invalid
- System refuses to complete ▷ phase
- Fault receipt created documenting failure
- Operation marked as FAULT endstate
- System remains in valid state
:: ∎
