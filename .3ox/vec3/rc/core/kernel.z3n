▛///▞ PLANE BINDING ::
//▞ Coordinate Space
type: span (subspace, not vector)
spanning_vectors: [eᵧ, e_z]
coordinate: span{[0,1,0], [0,0,1]}
semantic: execution + evidence = governance
translates: false

//▞ Governance Surface
binding: YZ-plane couples execution (Y-axis) to evidence (Z-axis)
constraint: governance decisions are evidence-constrained
enforcement: kernel is plane, not vector
violation: GOVERNANCE_FAULT
:: ∎

▛///▞ ρ{PRISM} :: PRISM Axioms

//▞ P_Position
meaning: Context binding — where does this operate?
binds: Spatial/temporal context
scope: YZ-plane governance surface

//▞ R_Role
meaning: Function binding — what does this do?
binds: Operational purpose
scope: Microkernel management and axiom enforcement

//▞ I_Intent
meaning: Purpose binding — why does this exist?
binds: Goal and justification
scope: System integrity and operational bounds

//▞ S_Structure
meaning: Form binding — how is this organized?
binds: Architectural constraints
scope: Microkernel properties and extension rules

//▞ M_Modality
meaning: Mode binding — under what conditions?
binds: Operational mode and constraints
scope: Axiomatic operations, deterministic execution
:: ∎

▛///▞ φ{Microkernel} :: Core Properties

//▞ MINIMAL
definition: Small core with explicit invariants
constraint: Only essential functions in kernel
rule: Complexity lives in extensions, not core

//▞ EXTENSIBLE
definition: Plugins cannot modify core
constraint: Extensions are additive only
rule: Core remains immutable; extensions compose

//▞ DETERMINISTIC
definition: Same inputs produce same outputs
constraint: No hidden state or randomness in core
rule: Reproducible execution for auditability

//▞ AUDITABLE
definition: All operations produce receipts
constraint: No silent operations
rule: Evidence is mandatory (Z-axis binding)

//▞ RECOVERABLE
definition: Clear failure states enable restart
constraint: FAULT states are documented
rule: System can resume from known states

//▞ Operating System Nature
- Compiled Rust exe runs code: this IS an OS
- vec3(0,0,0) is the origin of coordinate space
- 6 sides bound by 3 vectors define the system
- Sparkfile at origin defines capsule identity
:: ∎

▛///▞ τ{Governance} :: Governance Bounds

//▞ RESOURCE LIMITS
execution_time_ms: 30000
memory_allocation_mb: 512
concurrent_operations: 1
retry_limit: 3
receipt_storage_days: 365

enforcement: Hard limits checked before execution
violation: RESOURCE_FAULT

//▞ TRANSFORM LEGALITY

legal_transforms:
  - rotation: Reorient system perspective
  - scaling: Weight adjustment
  - composition: Chain transforms

illegal_transforms:
  - translation_of_directions: Directions have w=0
  - zeroing_entity_core: Identity cannot be erased
  - evidence_reduction: Evidence is monotonic
  - arbitrary_axis_mixing: Constrained by governance

enforcement: Transform validation before application
violation: TRANSFORM_FAULT
:: ∎

▛///▞ ENFORCEMENT ::

//▞ Kernel Doctrine
- Kernel is plane (span), not vector
- Kernel defines what transforms are legal
- Governance is evidence-constrained (YZ coupling)
- Violation produces documented FAULT

//▞ Fault Types
- GOVERNANCE_FAULT: Illegal operation attempted
- RESOURCE_FAULT: Limit exceeded
- TRANSFORM_FAULT: Invalid transform applied
- EVIDENCE_FAULT: Receipt missing or invalid

//▞ Recovery Protocol
- Detect fault condition
- Document fault type and context
- Halt operation cleanly
- Emit fault receipt
- System remains in recoverable state
