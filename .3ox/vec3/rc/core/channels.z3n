▛///▞ PLANE BINDING ::
//▞ Coordinate Space
type: span (subspace, not vector)
spanning_vectors: [eₓ, eᵧ]
coordinate: span{[1,0,0], [0,1,0]}
semantic: identity + execution = communication
translates: false

//▞ Communication Surface
binding: XY-plane couples identity (X-axis) to execution (Y-axis)
constraint: Communication streams are identity-bound and execution-validated
enforcement: Channels are plane, not vector
violation: CHANNEL_FAULT
:: ∎

▛///▞ ρ{Streams} :: Channel Definitions

//▞ CH0 :: core
name: core
content: Internal traces only (⊢ ⇨ ⟿ ▷ execution logs)
mode: OPERATOR
purpose: PiCO phase tracking and internal diagnostics
visible_to_user: false

//▞ CH1 :: receipt
name: receipt
content: Machine-readable witness artifacts
mode: OPERATOR
purpose: Formal proof of execution for audit
visible_to_user: false

//▞ CH2 :: primary
name: primary
content: User-facing answer only
mode: RESPONSE
purpose: Primary output to user
visible_to_user: true

//▞ CH3 :: responders
name: responders
content: λ.guard, ν.audit, τ.editor, ρ.echo blocks
mode: RESPONSE
purpose: Auditor and responder commentary
visible_to_user: true

//▞ CH4 :: patch
name: patch
content: Diffs, corrections, amendments
mode: OPERATOR + RESPONSE
purpose: Corrections and post-hoc amendments
visible_to_user: true (when applicable)

//▞ Channel Sealing
rule: Each channel has exactly one content type
enforcement: Output router validates channel assignment
violation: CHANNEL_FAULT if mixing detected
:: ∎

▛///▞ φ{Modes} :: Mode Binding

//▞ OPERATOR Mode
channels: [CH0, CH1, CH4]
purpose: Internal processing and auditing
visible_to_user: false
phase: Runs during ⊢ ⇨ ⟿ phases

//▞ RESPONSE Mode
channels: [CH2, CH3, CH4]
purpose: User-facing output
visible_to_user: true
phase: Runs during ▷ phase

//▞ Mode Switch
trigger: Receipt exists
from: OPERATOR
to: RESPONSE
gate: ⟿ phase complete

rule: Mode switch is gated by receipt existence
enforcement: Kernel blocks RESPONSE mode until receipt written
violation: MODE_FAULT if premature switch
:: ∎

▛///▞ τ{Routing} :: Channel Routing Rules

//▞ Routing Laws
R1: Each channel has exactly one content type
R2: Channel mixing is forbidden
R3: Mode switch occurs after receipt exists
R4: Responders cannot overwrite CH2 primary
R5: Patches live in CH4, never hidden in primary

rule: These routing laws are immutable
enforcement: Output router validates against laws before write
violation: CHANNEL_FAULT

//▞ Output Routing
- PiCO traces → CH0
- Receipts → CH1
- Primary answer → CH2
- Responder blocks → CH3
- Patches/diffs → CH4

//▞ Write Validation
before_write:
  - Check channel assignment against mode
  - Verify receipt exists if RESPONSE mode
  - Ensure no overwrites of sealed channels
  - Validate content type matches channel

enforcement: Router validates before every write
violation: CHANNEL_FAULT if validation fails
:: ∎

▛///▞ ENFORCEMENT ::

//▞ Channel Doctrine
- Channels are plane (span), not vector
- Channel violation = FAULT
- No mixing: each output goes to exactly one channel
- Mode switch is gated by receipt existence

//▞ Sealing Guards
- CH0 and CH1 are write-once in their phase
- CH2 cannot be overwritten after initial write
- CH3 appends only (multiple responders allowed)
- CH4 is version-tracked (diffs, not overwrites)

enforcement: Channel sealer validates write operations
violation: SEAL_FAULT if overwrite attempted

//▞ Recovery
- CHANNEL_FAULT: Routing violation detected
- System refuses write operation
- Fault receipt documents violation
- Channels remain in valid state
- System remains in recoverable state
