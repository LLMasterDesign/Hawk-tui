▛///▞ PLANE BINDING ::
//▞ Coordinate Space
type: span (subspace, not vector)
spanning_vectors: [eₓ, e_z]
coordinate: span{[1,0,0], [0,0,1]}
semantic: identity + evidence = permission
translates: false

//▞ Authority Surface
binding: XZ-plane couples identity (X-axis) to evidence (Z-axis)
constraint: Permission decisions are evidence-validated
enforcement: Authority is plane, not vector
violation: AUTHORITY_FAULT
:: ∎

▛///▞ ρ{Responders} :: Responder Types

//▞ λ.guard (Lambda Guard)
symbol: λ
channel: CH3
role: Policy enforcement and safety validation
capabilities:
  can_block: true
  can_emit: [warnings, policy_flags, refusals]
contract: May refuse publication, must provide reason
binding: Runs after receipt exists

//▞ ν.audit (Nu Audit)
symbol: ν
channel: CH3
role: Evidence verification and claim auditing
capabilities:
  can_block: false
  can_emit: [audit_notes, confidence_scores, unknown_flags]
contract: Verifies claims, cannot block
binding: Runs after receipt exists

//▞ τ.editor (Tau Editor)
symbol: τ
channel: CH4
role: Corrections and amendments
capabilities:
  can_block: false
  can_emit: [patches, diffs, corrections]
contract: Proposes changes, does not overwrite primary
binding: Writes to CH4 only, never CH2

//▞ ρ.echo (Rho Echo)
symbol: ρ
channel: CH3
role: Reflection and summary
capabilities:
  can_block: false
  can_emit: [summaries, reflections, context_notes]
contract: Summarizes, does not add new claims
binding: Runs after receipt exists
:: ∎

▛///▞ φ{Contracts} :: Responder Laws

//▞ Responder Laws
L1: Responders only run after receipt exists
L2: Responders only write to assigned channels
L3: Responders cannot overwrite CH2 primary
L4: Patches live in CH4, never hidden in primary
L5: Only λ.guard may block publication

rule: These contracts are immutable
enforcement: Kernel validates responder actions against contracts
violation: AUTHORITY_FAULT

//▞ Execution Sequence
1. Primary operation completes → receipt emitted
2. Responders triggered in order: ν.audit → λ.guard → ρ.echo
3. τ.editor runs if corrections needed
4. All responder output written to assigned channels
5. Responder receipt appended to primary receipt

//▞ Contract Validation
- Check responder against permission matrix
- Verify channel assignment
- Validate that receipt exists before responder runs
- Ensure no overwrites of primary output
:: ∎

▛///▞ τ{Permissions} :: Permission Matrix

//▞ Channel Permissions
λ.guard: [CH3]
ν.audit: [CH3]
τ.editor: [CH4]
ρ.echo: [CH3]

rule: Responders may ONLY write to assigned channels
enforcement: Channel validator checks before write
violation: AUTHORITY_FAULT

//▞ Action Permissions
block_publish: [λ.guard]
flag_unknown: [ν.audit]
emit_patch: [τ.editor]
summarize: [ρ.echo]

rule: Only λ.guard may block publication
enforcement: Block request validated against permission matrix
violation: AUTHORITY_FAULT

//▞ Evidence Requirements
- λ.guard must cite policy when blocking
- ν.audit must reference evidence sources
- τ.editor must diff against primary
- ρ.echo must not introduce new claims

enforcement: Evidence validator checks responder output
violation: EVIDENCE_FAULT if missing evidence
:: ∎

▛///▞ ENFORCEMENT ::

//▞ Authority Doctrine
- Authority is plane (span), not vector
- Responders are auditors, not characters
- Contract violation = AUTHORITY_FAULT
- Evidence strengthens authority (monotonic)

//▞ Permission Guards
- Responders cannot run before receipt exists
- Responders cannot write to forbidden channels
- Only λ.guard may block publication
- All responder actions must be evidence-backed

enforcement: Kernel validates before responder execution
violation: AUTHORITY_FAULT if contract violated

//▞ Recovery
- AUTHORITY_FAULT: Contract violation detected
- System refuses responder action
- Fault receipt documents violation
- Primary operation remains valid
- System remains in recoverable state
:: ∎
