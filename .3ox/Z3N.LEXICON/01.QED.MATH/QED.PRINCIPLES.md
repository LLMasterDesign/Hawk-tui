▛///▞ QED.PRINCIPLES :: FOUNDATIONS

QED (Quod Erat Demonstrandum) - "That which was to be demonstrated"
A methodology for applying mathematical proof structures to prompt engineering 
and code generation.

▛///▞ CORE.AXIOMS

A1:: VERIFIABILITY
  → Every prompt should produce verifiable outputs
  → Claims must be testable and provable
  → Results should be reproducible

A2:: STRUCTURE
  → Mathematical notation and formal logic enhance clarity
  → Hierarchical organization mirrors mathematical proofs
  → Step-by-step reasoning follows proof structure

A3:: CONSISTENCY
  → Terminology remains consistent across contexts
  → Patterns are reusable and composable
  → Rules are immutable within their scope

▛///▞ PROOF.STRUCTURE

Theorem → Statement to be proven
Given → Initial conditions and assumptions
Proof → Step-by-step logical progression
QED → Conclusion and verification

▛///▞ APPLICATION.TO.PROMPTING

ρ{Input}  → Given conditions, user requirements
φ{Process} → Proof steps, transformation rules
τ{Output}  → QED conclusion, verified result

▛///▞ MATHEMATICAL.NOTATION

→ Set notation: {elements}
→ Function notation: f(x) → y
→ Logical operators: ∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔
→ Quantifiers: ∀, ∃
→ Relations: ∈, ⊆, ⊂

▛▞// RESPONDER ⫎ ▸
QED principles provide a rigorous framework for prompt engineering, ensuring that 
interactions with AI systems follow logical structures and produce verifiable results.
